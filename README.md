# kali-like-terminal
![sample_terminal]()

If you switched from kali linux to any other distro you may have experienced an emptiness while using terminal, so here's a solution:
# install fish
https://fishshell.com/  
fish use similar syntax highlighting as autocompletion as kali's zsh
## set fish as your default shell
https://fishshell.com/docs/current/  

after that edit it's configuration file to get kali like 2 lined terminal  
'''fish
nano /etc/fish/config.fish  
now paste content from provided file, save and exit.  
reload terminal and you are done.
